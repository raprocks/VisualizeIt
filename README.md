## Getting Help

If you have any problem running the program raise an issue or contact me through any of my socials, I'll be glad to help.

## Contributing

We need to increase the number of algorithm that thee project visualizes. so firstly we need algorithms implemented in python. if you are interested in contributing to the project fork the repo, make your changes, commit them, push them to your fork and then submit a pull request.
I'll check on the pull request and merge it as soon as I can.
